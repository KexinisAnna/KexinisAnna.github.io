    summary: |
      My journey began with Applied Mathematics studies at the University of Toronto, 
      focusing on Statistics. I explored a range of topics like probability, 
      data analysis, statistical modeling, time series, machine learning, 
      and multivariate statistical analysis. 
      These studies set the stage for my hands-on roles at Answer Tech, 
      China Life Insurance, and Citic Securities. There, I learned to use tools like SQL, 
      SAS, and Python for real-world challenges.
